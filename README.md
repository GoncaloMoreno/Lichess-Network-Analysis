# Lichess-Network-Analysis
Analysis of the Lichess games and users network structure


 This project was a study on the the network dynamics and characteristics of the users and games from the \href{www.lichess.com}{Lichess} website. 
 For such, we not only had to analyze the common graph statistics such as centrality measures and distribution of nodes, but also if there are community-like structures in our network. Finally, we compute distance metrics to analyze how close together different players from different rating brackets are.
